#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expositry
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment

<u> <b>Description: </b> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
This experiment contains the circuit diagram of voltage to current converter and current to voltage converter using operational amplifier. Firstly user will connect input supply, ground and function generator to complete and design the circuit for current to voltage converter/ voltage to current converter circuit. Then user will check to examine whether the connections are correct/incorrect for current to voltage converter/ voltage to current converter circuit. Then the user will vary the input voltage/ current value to get corresponding current/voltage value.
